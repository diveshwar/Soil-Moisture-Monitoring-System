# Soil-Moisture-Monitoring-System
Efficient water management is a critical factor in modern agriculture. Overwatering can lead to root rot, while underwatering can reduce crop yield. This Soil Moisture Monitoring System is designed to help farmers, gardeners, and agricultural researchers by providing real-time soil moisture data through an IoT-enabled solution.
By integrating a soil moisture sensor with an ESP8266 microcontroller, this system continuously measures soil moisture levels and displays the data on a web-based dashboard. The system ensures precision irrigation, reducing water waste while improving crop productivity.

This project is a cost-effective, scalable, and easy-to-implement solution for smart farming.

Features
Real-time Monitoring – Continuously measures and updates soil moisture levels.
IoT-Based System – Uses ESP8266 WiFi module to transmit data wirelessly.
Web Dashboard – Displays soil moisture levels remotely.
Energy Efficient – Operates on minimal power consumption.
Cost-Effective – Suitable for small farms and research projects.
