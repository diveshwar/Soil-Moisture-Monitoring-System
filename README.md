# Soil-Moisture-Monitoring-System
Efficient water management is a critical factor in modern agriculture. Overwatering can lead to root rot, while underwatering can reduce crop yield. This Soil Moisture Monitoring System is designed to help farmers, gardeners, and agricultural researchers by providing real-time soil moisture data through an IoT-enabled solution.
By integrating a soil moisture sensor with an ESP8266 microcontroller, this system continuously measures soil moisture levels and displays the data on a web-based dashboard. The system ensures precision irrigation, reducing water waste while improving crop productivity.

This project is a cost-effective, scalable, and easy-to-implement solution for smart farming.
